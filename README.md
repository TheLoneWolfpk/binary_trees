 Binary trees

# Binary Tree
Binary tree is a special data structure used for data storage purposes. It has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. It has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

Note that tree represents the nodes connected by edges.

## Important Terms
* Path - Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.
* Root - The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.
* Parent - Any node except the root node that has one edge upward to a node is called a parent.
* Child - The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.
* Leaf - The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.
* Subtree - Subtree represents the descendants of a node.
* Visiting - Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is om the node.
* Traversing - Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.
* Levels - Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then it's next child node is at level 1, it's grandchild is at level 2, and so on and so forth.
* Keys - Key represents a value of a node based on whicj a search operation is to be carried out for a node.

Other things we were excepted to be able to explain to anyone without the help of google or anything at the end of this project is as follows:
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree(BST)
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What is the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different travesal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
